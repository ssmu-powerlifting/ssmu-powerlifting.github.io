Carl Majdalani represented SSMU powerlifting at the Montreal Classic 2015.
The meet was a great experience and many of the strongest lifters from Quebec participated.
We saw a great come back of JoÃ«l Boulianne with a 455 wilks.

Carl put up a total of 582.5 kg(1284 lbs) at a 95.8 kg bodyweight.
This sums up to a 361 Wilks and a meet PR for Carl. Congrats and
great continuation on his way to an elite powerlifting total.
